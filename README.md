# hackathon Project
To run this locally,

1. npm install

2. npm run dev


## You should add your own paid openai api key to fully utilise this application's functionalities.

### Here are some of the features we couldn't include due to the lack of time:
1. We planned to include text to video based outputs using huggingface models which allows the salesperson to place video calls as well along with the voice calls.
2. Voice response based on the tone of the speaker. The AI model adjusts it's tone according to the cusromer's change of tone using sentimental analysis.
3. Multiple product selection tools enable the salesperson to place the cold calls according to the product which they are selling.
4. Recording the optimal time and location for placing a cold call based on the previous interactions.

   THANK YOU
